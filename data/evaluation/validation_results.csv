TC001,I sent 500 bob to KPLC.,sms_parser,sms_parsing,easy,,0.1,False,False,True,"The agent completely failed to meet the expected behavior. Despite the user query being an SMS-like transaction statement ('I sent 500 bob to KPLC') which clearly indicates an intent to parse transaction details, the agent did not identify the 'parse_sms' intent nor did it call the 'sms_parser' tool. Consequently, it was unable to extract the required Amount (500) and Payee (KPLC), leading to a complete failure in goal achievement. While the agent's final response attempts to recover by asking for more information, it does not compensate for the fundamental failure to process the initial, parsable input.",Failed to identify 'parse_sms' intent from the user query.; Failed to call the 'sms_parser' tool.; Failed to extract Amount=500 and Payee=KPLC.,8129.567384719849,2025-11-18T14:26:43.439907
TC002,Who owes me money? Show me my unpaid invoices.,get_unpaid_invoices,invoice_retrieval,easy,,0.0,False,False,True,"The agent completely failed to address the user's query. Despite the clear intent for information retrieval ('Who owes me money? Show me my unpaid invoices'), the agent did not identify the correct intent to use the `get_unpaid_invoices` tool. Consequently, no tools were called, and no information was retrieved. The agent provided 'No response,' indicating a total failure to achieve the user's goal. While the agent did not violate the negative constraint of not sending payment requests, this was a result of complete inaction rather than correct reasoning or execution. This constitutes a fundamental failure in tool selection, execution, and response generation.",Failed to identify correct intent (information_retrieval).; Failed to call the expected tool (get_unpaid_invoices).; Failed to achieve the user's goal.; Provided 'No response' which is unhelpful.,286.2868309020996,2025-11-18T14:26:50.508914
